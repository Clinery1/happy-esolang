# Happy!
This is an esolang based off of [unhappy](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Unhappy), but MUCH easier to
work with.

# Why the name "Happy?"
Because the inspiration was "Unhappy," and this is better so it is Happy.

# Show me an example!
Here you go: `0:A:a="An example\n";;0>A`. This prints "An example" with a newline.

# How do I use this?
You create `program.happy` and write your entire program in that file.

# Why the limitations?
I said "slightly-more-useful," did I not? It is only slightly better with actual data types and
control flow.
